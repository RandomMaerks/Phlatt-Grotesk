# Phlatt Grotesk
Phlatt Grotesk, despite its laughable name (originally called Flat, but was changed for some unknown reason), is designed to be a serious typeface.

The design is inspired by the feel of Inter and the "flat" sides of Roboto and is intended to be generic in a way that should not grab too much attention of the reader.

The font contains around 1771 glyphs, including glyphs for the Latin, Greek and Cyrillic writing systems. Additionally, the font contains mathematical notations, subscript & superscript, numerators & denominators, IPA, geometric shapes, arrows, Bulgarian localisation, very obscure symbols and characters, etc.

# Phlatt Grotesk
Do you want a typeface that is specifically multifunctional but boring-looking, faceless, non-distracting, uninterruptive and also formal, slightly unique, slightly not, and kinda looks like if Inter and Roboto had a baby? Well most of you probably don't. But if you just so happen to find this typeface while looking for exactly that, you are in for a treat.

Phlatt Grotesk, despite its laughable name (originally called Flat, but was changed for some unknown reason), was designed to be a serious typeface. It is extremely functional, legible, and useful.

The design is inspired by the feel of Inter and the "flat" sides of Roboto (basically the entire Apple's SF Family). It was also designed to be very generic and boring (should not grab too much attention of the viewers).

The font contains around 1771 glyphs, and supports many languages like Latin, Vietnamese, Greek, Cyrillic. It also has IPA so you can use the font in dictionaries, more dictionaries, even more dictionaries,... Additionally, the font contains mathematical notations, subscript & superscript, numerators & denominators, geometric shapes, arrows, Bulgarian localisation, very obscure symbols and characters, etc.
